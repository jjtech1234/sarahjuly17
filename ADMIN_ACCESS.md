# Admin Access Instructions

## Quick Admin Access (Temporary)

Since there are authentication complexities, here's the current status:

**Current Admin User in Database:**
- Email: `admin@b2bmarket.com`
- Role: `admin`
- Status: Active

**Issue:** The password hash needs to be reset for this user.

## Alternative: Create New Admin User

You can create a new admin user by:

1. **Register a new account** on the website with any email/password
2. **Contact the developer** to set that user's role to 'admin' in the database
3. **Use that account** to access `/admin`

## What the Admin Page Contains:

- **Business Inquiries Management** - View and manage customer inquiries
- **Advertisement Management** - Review and approve/deny advertisements
- **Business Listings** - Manage business sale listings
- **User Management** - Admin controls for user accounts

## Security Features Already Implemented:

✅ **Frontend Protection** - Access denied page for non-admin users
✅ **Backend Protection** - All admin endpoints require admin role
✅ **Security Logging** - Failed access attempts are logged
✅ **Role-Based Access** - Only admin role can access admin features

The admin security is working correctly - it's just the initial admin user setup that needs to be completed.
