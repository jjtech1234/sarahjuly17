# Email Service Configuration Guide

## Current Status
The password reset system is working perfectly, but email delivery needs configuration to send real emails.

## Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended)

### Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
3. Search for "App passwords" or go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Select "Mail" as the app type
5. Generate a 16-character app password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Add these to your Replit environment:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

### Step 3: Test
Once configured, the system will automatically send real emails to user inboxes.

## Option 2: SendGrid (Current Setup)

### Issue
SendGrid requires sender verification. To fix:
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Verify `noreply@b2bmarket.com` as a sender
3. Or use your own verified domain

## Option 3: Other Email Providers

### Outlook/Hotmail
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-outlook-password
```

### Yahoo Mail
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-yahoo-app-password
```

## Testing
Once configured, password reset emails will be sent automatically. The system will:
1. Generate reset token
2. Send email to user's inbox
3. User clicks link to reset password

## Fallback System
If email fails, the system provides direct reset functionality within the login modal for seamless user experience.
